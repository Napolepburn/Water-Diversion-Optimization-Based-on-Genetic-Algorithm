# Water-Diversion-Optimization-Based-on-Genetic-Algorithm
Daily-scale water resource dispatching system with optimization function written in python

Brief description:
(a) A daily-scale water resources allocation system written in Python (involving the joint dispatch of 5 reservoirs).
(b) The combinations of 57 decision variables (e.g., design diversion, reservoir operation) were optimized to reach Pareto-fronts for irrigation water supply guarantee rates of multiple reservoirs.
